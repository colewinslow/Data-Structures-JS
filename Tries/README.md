# Data Structures: Tries

## Overview

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys. It is particularly useful for storing and searching for strings or sequences of characters. Tries are commonly used in scenarios where prefix-based searches or autocomplete functionality is required.

Tries have the following key characteristics:

- **Prefix-Based Structure**: Tries are designed to efficiently store and search for keys based on their prefixes. Each node in the trie represents a character, and traversing from the root to a node forms a key or a prefix of a key.

- **Efficient String Search**: Tries allow for efficient string search operations, such as checking if a given key exists in the trie or finding all keys with a specific prefix.

- **Space Optimization**: Tries optimize space by sharing common prefixes among keys. This enables efficient storage of large collections of keys with shared prefixes.

## Tries in JavaScript

In JavaScript, tries can be implemented using custom classes or objects. Each node in the trie can be represented as an object or an instance of a class with properties for the character, a flag indicating if it represents the end of a key, and references to its child nodes.

Custom trie implementations in JavaScript typically include methods for inserting keys, searching for keys or prefixes, and removing keys from the trie. These methods involve traversing the trie based on the characters in the keys.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time and space complexity of trie operations depend on the specific operation and the length of the keys involved:

- **Insertion**: Inserting a key into a trie takes O(k) time complexity, where k is the length of the key. The time complexity is proportional to the length of the key being inserted.

- **Search**: Searching for a key in a trie takes O(k) time complexity as well. The time complexity depends on the length of the key being searched.

- **Prefix Search**: Searching for keys with a specific prefix takes O(p) time complexity, where p is the length of the prefix. The time complexity is proportional to the length of the prefix being searched.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of a trie depends on the number of unique keys stored in it and the average length of the keys. It can be larger than other data structures due to the overhead of storing individual characters in each node.

Tries are efficient for prefix-based search operations and can provide significant performance benefits in scenarios where prefix matching or autocomplete functionality is required.
