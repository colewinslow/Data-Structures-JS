## Traversal Algorithms

Graph traversal algorithms are used to visit or explore the nodes of a graph. Here are two commonly used algorithms:

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a specific node (or vertex) and recursively visits all its adjacent nodes before moving on to the next adjacent unvisited node.

DFS can be useful for tasks such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, or traversing a graph in a specific order.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the same level before moving to the next level. It starts at a specific node and visits all its neighboring nodes first before moving on to their neighbors.

BFS can be useful for tasks such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, calculating the diameter of a tree, or determining connectivity.

These algorithms can be implemented in JavaScript using various approaches, such as recursion or iteration with data structures like stacks or queues.

Keep in mind that the implementation details may vary based on the specific graph representation used, whether it's an adjacency list, an adjacency matrix, or other data structures.
