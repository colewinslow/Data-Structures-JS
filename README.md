# Data Structures in JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in JavaScript. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific data structure and provides information on its characteristics and usage in JavaScript.

## Subdirectories

- **Arrays**: This directory contains implementations and information about arrays, which are used to store a collection of elements in a sequential manner.

- **Binary-Trees**: This directory contains implementations and information about binary trees, which are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes with at most two children.

- **Graphs**: This directory contains implementations and information about graphs, which are composed of vertices (nodes) connected by edges, representing relationships between objects.

- **Hash-Map**: This directory contains implementations and information about hash maps, also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, which store key-value pairs for efficient lookup and retrieval.

- **Heaps**: This directory contains implementations and information about heaps, which are complete binary trees with a specific ordering property that allows for efficient retrieval of the maximum or minimum element.

- **Linked-Lists**: This directory contains implementations and information about linked lists, which are linear data structures consisting of nodes linked together in a sequence.

- **Queues**: This directory contains implementations and information about queues, which follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and allow efficient insertion and removal of elements.

- **Stack**: This directory contains implementations and information about stacks, which follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and allow efficient insertion and removal of elements.

- **Sets**: This directory contains implementations and information about sets, which store unique elements and provide efficient membership testing operations.

- **Tries**: This directory contains implementations and information about tries (prefix trees), which are used for efficient retrieval of keys based on prefixes.

Each subdirectory includes a README file that provides more detailed information about the specific data structure, its characteristics, and its implementation in JavaScript.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory to learn more about the data structures and their implementations in JavaScript.
