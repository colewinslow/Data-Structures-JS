# Data Structures: Heaps

## Overview

A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are often used to efficiently maintain the maximum (max heap) or minimum (min heap) element at the root of the tree. They are commonly used in priority queues and sorting algorithms.

Heaps have the following key characteristics:

- **Heap Property**: In a max heap, for every node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min heap, the value of every node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This property ensures that the maximum (or minimum) element is always at the root of the heap.

- **Complete Binary Tree**: Heaps are typically implemented using complete binary trees, where all levels of the tree are filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. This property allows for efficient storage of elements in an array-based representation.

- **Efficient Insertion and Removal**: Heaps provide efficient insertion and removal of the maximum (or minimum) element at the root. These operations maintain the heap property by reordering elements as needed.

## Heaps in JavaScript

In JavaScript, heaps can be implemented using arrays or custom classes. The array-based implementation is a common approach for heaps, where the indices of the array represent the tree structure.

JavaScript does not have a built-in implementation of heaps, but you can create custom heap implementations using arrays or by defining classes with appropriate methods for heap operations.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of basic heap operations depends on the specific operation:

- **Insertion**: Inserting an element into a heap takes O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the heap.

- **Removal**: Removing the maximum (or minimum) element from a heap also takes O(log n) time complexity.

- **Accessing the Maximum (or Minimum) Element**: Accessing the maximum (or minimum) element at the root of the heap takes constant time, O(1).

- **Heap Construction**: Constructing a heap from an array of elements can be done in O(n) time complexity.

The space complexity of a heap is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the heap. This space is required to store the elements in the array-based representation.

Keep in mind that heaps are not meant for efficient searching or accessing arbitrary elements. They are primarily designed for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of the maximum (or minimum) element.
